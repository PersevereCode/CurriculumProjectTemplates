# Curriculum Project Templates
One easy place to get start repositories for students to complete curriculum projects

## Why this repo is necessary
Students, like any developer, should be spending their time making cool projects, not making sure "!Doctype" is in all caps. By providing this resources we helping to stundents to learn the important parts of coding faster, and making the lives of instructors easier.

## Notable Features
- Projects that are applicable, contain a local version of FCC's testing suit, to allow students to check their user stories before submitting.
- node_modules : they are required in the majority of projects that we assign, and each project requires a different set of modules. This repo will help us keep track of whata projects need what.
